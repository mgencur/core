msgid "Dependency injection enables loose-coupling by allowing the implementation of the injected bean type to vary, either a deployment time or runtime. Events go one step further, allowing beans to interact with no compile time dependency at all. Event <emphasis>producers</emphasis> raise events that are delivered to event <emphasis>observers</emphasis> by the container."

The qualifiers function like topic selectors, allowing an observer to narrow the set of events it observes."
